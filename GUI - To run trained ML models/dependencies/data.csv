GCR08870414	Non Functioning or damaged	Elastic	Hi, This is now the second pack of Pampers New Baby 94's (size 2) that's defective. The elastic in the nappy that keeps poop in the nappy is loose. It is currently almost 4 in the morning and I had to change both myself and baby. The reason why I didn't report the other pack is because I was not aware that I can lodge a complaint when I used nappies from the pack already. I have to purchase a new one tomorrow. So disappointed with Pampers at the moment.
GCR08875713	Dissatisfied with performance	Did not cover, stretch, fit	I have been having a problem with the recent Size 4 Pampers I bought at Makro. The Pampers diaper gets full quicker this time around. The 1 2hrs you wrote in the package is totally a joke as the diaper has to be changed every 2hrs. If you don't change it baby would be soaking wet as the gel inside can no longer absorb the urine. It has been embarrassing more than once.The diaper sags and you can see that the child is getting uncomfortable. It has come to a point that I buy a water proof for my son to wear so that he doesn't wake up wet should I oversleep and change him after 3hrs+. I have been using Pampers Premium and Pampers active since my son was born and with my first child but this time I am not satisfied with your product.
GCR08878627	Dissatisfied with performance	Leaks; urine	"I am really disappointed by your new Pampers product..""air""..have been using Pampers for the last seven years for my little ones.And it was good quality was my number 1 choice but not anymore. The quality of the new product is way too low.My 8 months boy can't stay dry overnight anymore. I have to change his diaper in the middle of the night this is so ridiculous. Now forced to switch to Huggies ."
GCR08879074	Dissatisfied with performance	Leaks; urine	Good day, I hope this email finds you well, my name is ********* and I would like to lodge a concern about your nappies. My sister purchased the mega box of Pampers 4+ on the 29th of April. We have been using your brand in our family for years as we trust your products. However, with the last box that she purchased, the baby gets wet every time and it even soils her clothing. There is definitely something missing inside the nappy and we are not sure what the problem is. Please be so kind as to collect a nappy for further investigation. In the meantime we had to purchase another brand as we are scared to buy Pampers now in order to avoid the same thing from happening. Should you have any queries, please do not hesitate to contact me on my mobile or email. Kind Regards, ***************
GCR08885204	Dissatisfied with performance	Leaks; urine	Morning, trust u are well I have been using Pampers for my baby since birth for now 6 months I purchased a jumbo pack last week from***********, however it does not hold by the thighs I have attached the picture, please have a look as it keeps on leaking
GCR08886990	Non Functioning or damaged	Tapes; miscut	I got two Pampers Active Baby Dry diapers (size 3-94 diapers) that were not manufactured correctly, which is a total waste of a customers money as we pay way too much for diapers. The one diaper did not have a sticky tape on the right hand side and the other diaper had a sticky tab that was placed upside down. The pictures are attached to indicate these defects.
GCR08896150	Non Functioning or damaged	Elastic	from the time our son was born in 2018 we have been using Pampers nappies, as it is the best only nappies that agree to his skin. we have been happy with the product up until this year February. we have now twice found a problem with the product where the elastic on the sides are threading and the gel that is meant to hold his pee for up to 12 hours leaks after he has his 1st pee. we only buy the mega box as it was out more cheaper and convenient for us. we would like to know what is happening with the product? We cannot keep returning the box because we have to wait 6 weeks before the problem is resolved and we still haven't been given an answer from ******* where we only buy Pampers from and have returned it there. so could you guys please give us an answer to that.
GCR08898597	Non Functioning or damaged	Ear; breaks, tears	Good day. I have two kids, 44 months and 17 months. I've used Pampers all the time for both. I ALWAYS buy my nappies at Game or Dischem but I got desperate earlier this month (15 April) and because I stay next to Columbine Square and checkers was open,I went and bought a jumbo pack of Pampers Active Baby Dry (size 4+ - 62 diapers). This is not the Pampers I'm used to. More than 15 nappies are damaged. The topsheet is coming off of one of the diapers and one of the ears of another diapers is tearing. It is like I bought a bad batch. The number on the diaper is *************** (not too visible). This is my biggest regret ever and I feel robbed of my R225. I understand Checkers is just a retailer, you are the manufacturer so please assist, I would like to have my money back. Attachment ERROR: File size limit reached

GCR08902098	Dissatisfied with performance	Did not cover, stretch, fit	Pamper air is horrible. I will be changing brands for sure. I literally throwing away money. This is really bad. I please stop buying them
GCR08912910	Non Functioning or damaged	Ear; missing	Good Day I purchased two boxes of Pampers mega Boxes, both at ********stores (********* and **************) 1 in March 2019 and the other in April 2019 Both boxes had nappies without the ear. ******************** ******************** I do have the nappies as well as photos if required.
GCR08923248	Non Functioning or damaged	Leaks AGM; gel	Dear Pampers We are using Pampers nappies Number 4+ for our baby at the moment. We found that the nappies tear open on the sides which then cause the AGM gelatin to come out and fall out down his legs in his pants. It seems like the nappies's stitching is coming loose. This happened more than 3 times lately while the nappy wasn't on him for a long time, and it didn't even absorb a lot of fluids so that makes the nappy to get full and swollen. Once in a while on emergencies we used some cheap nappies which you will expect to be of poor quality, but something like this never happened. We use Pampers from our child's birth which is one of the most expensive brands of nappies and which we are supposed to trust and rely on with our child and I must say that the quality of the nappies lately are disappointing. I will attach pictures which also have the batch number on it Regards. Attachment ERROR: File size limit reached
